Introduction
The Arduino 8 Lamp Manager is a Windows application designed to control up to 8 LEDs connected to an Arduino via an HC-06 or HC-05 Bluetooth module. This project provides an easy-to-use interface for managing the state of each LED, making it ideal for home automation projects, educational purposes, and prototyping.

Features
Control up to 8 LEDs via Bluetooth
Simple and intuitive Windows interface
Real-time status updates
Easy setup and configuration
Open-source and customizable
Hardware Requirements
Arduino (e.g., Uno, Mega)
HC-06 or HC-05 Bluetooth module
8 LEDs
8 resistors (220Î© recommended)
Breadboard and jumper wires
Bluetooth-enabled Windows PC
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
HC-05 Bluetooth Serial Library
Windows 7 or higher
Setup Instructions
Arduino Side
Connect the HC-06/HC-05 Bluetooth Module:

VCC to 5V on Arduino
GND to GND on Arduino
TXD to RX on Arduino (pin 0)
RXD to TX on Arduino (pin 1)
Connect the LEDs:

Connect each LED to a digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pins 2-9) with a resistor in series.
Upload the Sketch:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Load the provided sketch from the Arduino directory of this repository.
Upload the sketch to the Arduino.
Windows Application
Download and Install:

Download the latest release of the Windows app from the Releases page.
Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
Pair the Bluetooth Module:

Open Bluetooth settings on your PC.
Pair with the HC-06/HC-05 module (default pin is usually 1234 or 0000).
Configure the App:

Open the Arduino 8 Lamp Manager app.
Select the COM port associated with the Bluetooth module.
Connect and start controlling your LEDs!
Usage
Launching the App:

Open the Arduino 8 Lamp Manager from the Start menu or desktop shortcut.
Controlling LEDs:

Use the app's interface to toggle each LED on or off.
The app provides real-time feedback on the status of each LED.
